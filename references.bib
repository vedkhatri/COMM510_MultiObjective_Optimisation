abstract = {Recently, evolutionary algorithms have made great achievements in multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), but there is a little research on how to deal with noisy multi-objective optimization problems (NMOPs), which are quite common in real life. The work in this paper attempts to find the commonality of noises in images/signals and NMOPs and analyzes the effects of several classical smoothing techniques in images/signals on NMOPs. A novel denoising algorithm that embeds the mean and Wiener filters into existing multi-objective optimization algorithms is proposed. In the proposed method, resampling is employed to maintain the accuracy of non-dominated solutions and filters are utilized to denoise dominated solutions, where the mean and Wiener filters are conducive to balance convergence and diversity of the population, respectively. This is the first use of filters in NMOPs, and it will promote the application of denoising methods in images/signals to NMOPs. The empirical results show the superiority of filters to denoise problems with low/medium-intensity noises and continuous Pareto front, compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {Objective evaluation is subject to noise in many real-world problems. The noise can deteriorate the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, by misleading the population to a local optimum and reducing the convergence rate. This paper proposes three novel noise handling techniques: accumulative sampling, a new ranking method, and a different selection scheme for recombination. The accumulative sampling is basically a kind of dynamic resampling, but it does not explicitly decide the number of samples. Instead, it repeatedly takes additional samples of objectives for the solutions in the archive at every generation, and updates the estimated objectives using all the accumulated samples. The new ranking method combines probabilistic Pareto rank and crowding distance into a single aggregated value to promote the diversity in the archive. Finally, the fitness function and selection method used for recombination are made different from those for the archive to accelerate the convergence rate. Experiments on various benchmark problems have shown that the algorithm adopting all these features performs better than other MOEAs in various performance metrics.},
