\begin{abstract}
  Noise on the objective functions has been seen to be detrimental to the performance of standard evolutionary multi-objective optimisers. This has led to the development of bespoke optimisers for this type of problem. In addition to these, it has been observed that small amounts of noise can be beneficial to some multi-objective search algorithms, even using optimisers that assume no noise is present. This project investigates the combination of problem type, noise type and magnitude, and explores the underlying relationship between performance of standard optimisers in noisy problems are, and the situation led to improved performance when noise is present. The paper concludes with comparisons drawn and interpreting results in form of comparison plots of different combinations.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Noise is an unavoidable and an inevitable element that is present in many real-world optimisation problems \cite{branke2003}. When modelling these problems, noise causes variation to the output, leading to a solution that may not reflect the true coefficients. A common group of multi-objective algorithms used in tackling noisy environments is Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), due their high tolerance to highly nonlinear and noisy system models \cite{then1994, hughes2001}. There have been a number of EAs developed in tackling noise, with approaches including resampling. The effectiveness of these algorithms has been tested by aritificially adding noise of a certain form \cite{hughes2001} Along with developing such algorithms, there has been considerable study on how noise could affect the efficiency of multi-objective optimisers. Whilst some algorithms have exhibited robust and resilient attributes when dealing with certain intensity of noise, there have been optimisers demonstrating beneficial behaviour when subjected to small amounts of noise. This uncanny behaviour in rare scenarios is conjectured to be the result of increased diversity in the elite population \cite{fieldsend2015}.
